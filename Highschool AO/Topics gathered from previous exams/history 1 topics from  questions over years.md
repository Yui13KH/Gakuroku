Got it 👍 You’ve basically dumped the **History 1 (Tarih 1) question pool**, same way as we did with Biology and Health. Let me clean this into a **study outline (English + Turkish)** with key points → so you’ll know what the big themes are, and then you can read in detail from your book or check extra sources.

Want me to also make you a **condensed “Anki-style” version** (short Q/A flash format) for History 1 like:

- _Q: Who invented the first alphabet?_
    
- _A: Phoenicians (Fenikeliler)._
    

That way you can directly drop them into Anki instead of rewriting?
