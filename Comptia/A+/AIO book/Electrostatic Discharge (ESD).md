basically your body can carry an electrical charge as small as it might be , ( like sometimes u touch metallic stuff and get shocked )

these if present while fixing a electronical part may damage them so there are tools called 

*Antistatic Tools*  

which makes the electrical potential of you and the device being operated on the same , you simply connect one end on ur wrist (skin) and the other on anyplace on the device

its usually called "grounding yourself"

as such components can pickup electrical potential if u just put them aside so theres a *antistatic mat* that " the greatest technican that ever lived" use to not harm the components

also same idea for a bag if u are gonna transfer the components somewhere else

note : if u dont have a esd strap you could touch the power supply for like a minute or two to like try grounding yourself not as good as esd strap but better then nothing

### Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
A magnetic field interfering with electronics is electromagnetic interference (EMI).

summary : keep magnets away , everything with a motor is a small magnet speakers phones etc



### Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
basically keep things that emit radio frequencies weather it be oven or other stuff microwave etc
	theres a way to tune devices on different frequencies so that they dont interfere later in ch20
