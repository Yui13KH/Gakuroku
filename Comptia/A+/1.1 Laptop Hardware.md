# Laptop Components and Upgrades

## Battery
- Some manufacturers make batteries **modular and easy to swap**, while others build them into the system.
- Most batteries are:
  - **Lithium-ion (Li-ion)**
  - **Lithium-ion Polymer (LiPo)**
- Both types eliminate the *memory effect* found in older battery technologies.

## Keyboard
- The keyboard is one of the most frequently replaced parts in laptops.
- Many manufacturers make replacement easy:
  1. Pop up the keyboard.
  2. Disconnect the ribbon cable.
  3. Connect the new keyboard.
- For troubleshooting, you can always plug in a **USB keyboard**.
- Sometimes the issue is just a **single key**, which can be replaced carefully without replacing the entire keyboard.

## Memory (RAM)
- Laptops use **Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Modules (SO-DIMM)**.
- These are usually easy to swap or upgrade.
- Some laptops have RAM **soldered to the motherboard**, making upgrades impossible.

## Storage
- **Older laptops** used 2.5" HDDs (mechanical spinning drives).  
  - Slow performance.  
  - Prone to mechanical failure.
- **Modern laptops** use SSDs (solid-state drives):
  - Fully memory-based with no moving parts.
  - Smaller and faster than HDDs.
  - Connection types:
    - **SATA** (separate connectors for data and power)
    - **M.2 / NVMe** (single compact slot)
- Migrating from HDD to SSD may require **specialized cloning software** to create a full system image.

## Wireless Network Connectivity
- Most laptops have modular **Wi-Fi (802.11)** and **Bluetooth** cards.
- Upgrading is simple:
  1. Remove the old card.
  2. Install the new one.
  3. Attach the antenna cables.
- **Wi-Fi (802.11)**: High-speed LAN connection to the internet.  
- **Bluetooth**: PAN (Personal Area Network), commonly used for connecting peripherals such as mice, keyboards, and headphones.

## Biometrics
- Many newer laptops support biometric authentication, such as:
  - Fingerprint readers.
  - Face recognition systems.

---

## Near Field Communication (NFC)
- Very short-range communication (≤4 cm).
- Common uses:
  - Access cards.
  - Contactless payments.
  - Public transportation passes.

---

## Camera / Webcam
- Used for recording videos or real-time streaming.
- Some webcams have built-in microphones or are positioned near the laptop’s speakers.
