# Cellular Networks & Mobile Communication

## Overview
Mobile devices are often referred to as **cell phones** because their network coverage is provided by **cellular towers** (antennas) arranged in geographical **"cells"**.  
Each cell operates on specific frequencies, enabling both **voice** and **data** communication.

**Airplane Mode**: Disables all wireless communications (cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). You can manually re-enable specific connections while in airplane mode (e.g., Wi-Fi).

## 3G Technology
- **Introduced**: 1998  
- **Speed**: Several megabits per second (Mbps).  
- **Key Features Enabled**:
  - GPS navigation
  - Mobile television
  - Video on demand
  - Video conferencing

---

## 4G and LTE
- **LTE** = *Long-Term Evolution* (a 4G technology).
- Based on:
  - GSM (*Global System for Mobile Communications*)
  - EDGE (*Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution*)
- **Standard LTE**: ~150 Mbps download speed.
- **LTE-A (Advanced)**: ~300 Mbps download speed.

---

## 5G
- **Launched**: Worldwide in 2020.  
- **Performance**:
  - Theoretical peak: ~10 Gbps
  - Typical: 100–900 Mbps
- Operates at **higher frequencies** (including millimeter wave bands).
- **Impact**:
  - Massive improvement for IoT (*Internet of Things*).
  - Larger and faster data transfers.
  - Low latency for real-time monitoring and notifications.
  - Enhanced cloud-based processing.

---

## Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
- **Advantages**:
  - Higher speeds than cellular (in most cases).
  - Does not consume cellular bandwidth.
- **Limitations**:
  - Shorter range compared to cellular networks.
- Supports:
  - Voice
  - Video
  - Data

**Mobile Hotspot**:
- Turns your phone into a **Wi-Fi router**.
- Shares cellular data connection with multiple devices.
- Usually built into modern smartphones (must be enabled manually).

---

## SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)
- **Purpose**: Uniquely identifies the subscriber to the cellular network.
- **Physical SIM**:  
  - Small removable card containing:
    - SIM ID and phone number
    - Carrier/network information
    - Storage for contacts and SMS messages
- **eSIM** (*Embedded SIM*):
  - Built into the device (non-removable).
  - Supports multiple profiles on one device.

---

## Bluetooth Pairing
- Short-range wireless communication (typically <10 m, though Class 1 devices can reach ~100 m).
- **Security**: Uses a PIN or passkey for pairing.
- Pairing is usually one-time; credentials are stored for future connections.

---

## GPS (Global Positioning System)
- Uses a network of **~31 satellites** in orbit.
- Requires signals from **at least 4 satellites** for accurate positioning.
- Determines location using **time difference of signal arrival** to calculate:
  - Longitude
  - Latitude
  - Altitude
- Can be augmented by:
  - **Wi-Fi positioning** (SSID database)
  - **Cellular triangulation**

| 5G         | 100 Mbps – 10 Gbps   | 2020            | Low latency, IoT boost |



### Mobile Device Management


if you have a company u would want the workers phones to be managed in some way for security 
so you'd need to use a mdm (mobile device management) both company owned and user owned under the BYOD (bring your own device) you could like set permissions and like allowance  like allowing camera access or gbs which apps are allowed and not etc and you could enforce security policies for both the employee and the company

the mdm manages this like what data is for the company what happens to it if the phone is lost or stolesn or sold etc

some companies are too gigachads so they just COPE ( cooperate owned persoanlly enabled) 
	basically the copmany gets the phone and assign it to the employee and have full control of that device sometimes it is given to the employee as a personal device and they can control everything like the data and permissions 
some companies might CYOD ( choose your own device )
similar to COPE but the user chooses the device 


mdm policy enforcement 
sometimes depending on company they might enforce the use of a mdm and then the company take cares of all the configs the employee doesnt have to do anything it just works like allowing or prevent installing certain application
