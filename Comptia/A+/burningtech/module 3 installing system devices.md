power supplies usually come in 2 modes or at least the old ones used to have 2 options 

input volts AC (VAC)
	100 - 127 low line
	or
	220 - 240 high line
and depending on where u live u had to like actually change that tho newer psu's dont have that its usually set for u if u bought the psu from in the country 

*according to burning ice tech those come in pbq*

### power connecters

	20 vs 24 pin  "20 pins are legacy"
		note : ifffffff by miraculous luck u do have to connect a 20 pin old motherboard thing the new 24 pin connectors are made to be backward compatible 4 pins are detachable 
	 "main power connector to the mother board "
